	    <a href="/index">Eric T. Lander</a>
	    <h4>I have worked on various topics: articles, deixis, demonstratives, complementizers, factivity, grammaticalization, ontological categories, and negation. 
		A number of my papers, often in collaboration with colleagues, have approached crosslinguistic variation from a nanosyntactic perspective. 
		I am currently working on a large-scale study of sentential negation in the early Nordic dialects, using runic, Eddic, and skaldic data. In addition to my
	    pursuits in Old Germanic, I am also interested in linguistic theory and typology more generally.</h4>
	    <h4>Below is a list of my peer-reviewed publications, some of which can be downloaded. I also use this list as an opportunity to acknowledge and correct - to the best of my knowledge - 
		    any mistakes or errors on my part, so some of the papers include corrigenda. If you'd like to get in touch with me regarding my research, feel free to <a href="/CV_and_contact">email</a> me.</h4>
