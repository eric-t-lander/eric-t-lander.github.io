        <h3>I have worked on various topics: articles, deixis, demonstratives, complementizers, factivity, grammaticalization, ontological categories, and negation. 
		A number of my papers, often in collaboration with colleagues, have approached crosslinguistic variation from a nanosyntactic perspective. 
		I am currently working on a large-scale study of sentential negation in the early Nordic dialects, using runic, Eddic, and skaldic data.</h3>
