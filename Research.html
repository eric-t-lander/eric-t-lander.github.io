	    <h4>I have worked on various topics: articles, deixis, demonstratives, complementizers, factivity, grammaticalization, ontological categories, and negation. 
		A number of my papers, often in collaboration with colleagues, have approached crosslinguistic variation from a nanosyntactic perspective. 
		I am currently working on a large-scale study of sentential negation in the early Nordic dialects, using runic, Eddic, and skaldic data.</h4>
	    <h4>Below is a list of my peer-reviewed publications, some of which can be downloaded. I also use this list as an opportunity to acknowledge and correct 
		    any mistakes on my part, so some of the papers include corrigenda. If you'd like to get in touch with me regarding my research, feel free to</h4>
